3,2017/2/5,google_play,Christopher Robin,134,en,"Beautiful in concept, Syncthing was a brilliant 5 star app. It was very stable through many versions over the year I had been using it, but started repeatedly crashing from v.0.8.6. Sometimes it forced a reboot of the device. Installing ST 0.9.0 from scratch on 3 Android devices, it crashed on every device add, on almost every folder add, and in use crashed continually. 0.9.1 no better despite trying every conceivable combination of 'experimental features'. Reports other devices as disconnected when they should be connected, and vica versa. Ditto 0.9.2. 0.9.3 unusable. Now reinstalled 0.8.4 which is the last version that worked for me, and everything is working except the ongoing issue that it doesn't propagate deletions of some files.

Often cannot help to click Restart (need to be closed manually), plenty times I have to connect devices into the same wifi to synchronize. When I added third device, really weird problems appeared. Dev A synchronize to B, B to C, C make some changed, that did not propagate until A (not familiar with C at all) was restarted, etc, etc.... After of hours, I have to uninstall. I believe it is working in other platforms, but Android 4.4, 5.0 - no luck, I also seen crashed it sometimes.

It's sometimes very handy for transfering files without having to use any wires or to keep on sync savefiles, configurations, documents, etc.  The GUI mimics the web interface behavior.. it kind of makes you wonder why did they bother writing a dedicated GUI when they could have simply opened the web interface from a webview and just made sure it uses proper html5/css3 tricks to be suitable for small devices. Specially since you might still want to use the web interface to add paths.",https://appbot.co/apps/1392427-syncthing/reviews/470339368,None,neutral,,,,,
